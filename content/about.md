About this site
==============================================

The primary focus of this site is to:

* To be used in teaching the [dbwebb course design](http://dbwebb.se/design).

The site is maintained and modified by Lösningen, and will be used throughout the design course.  
We will learn about Markdown, LESS and typography in this course.

Maybe I'll learn one thing or two about designing webpages...
