##A little about breakline and newline

A simple breakline in editor will not suffice as seen below.
>This will not 
break line

```
This will not 
break line
```

However, if you put two spaces behind a line, it breaklines.

>This will   
break line

```
This will   
break line
```

If you use double newlines in the editor, it will be a space between.

>This will
>
>new line

```
This will

new line
```

##Syntax hilighting

```php
<?php
echo phpinfo();
?>
```
